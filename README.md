# HC MID template repository, version `0.10.2`


This is a template repository illustrating HC MID validation and verification using an interactive Pluto notebook.

Current documentation for setting up and working with an editing repository based on or copied from this model is available at <https://hcmid.github.io/tutorial2021/>.

## Status

The validating notebook is in early stages of development.  The [project issue tracker](https://github.com/HCMID/validatormodel/issues) includes a 1.0 milestone identifying issues that need to be resolved before the notebook can be considered mature enough to constitute a thorough validation of cross-project MID standards for editing projects.
