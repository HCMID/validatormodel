# HC MID template repository, version `0.15.0`

This is a template repository illustrating HC MID validation and verification using an interactive Pluto notebook.

Current documentation for setting up and working with an editing repository based on or copied from this model is available at <https://hcmid.github.io/tutorial2021/>.


## About the validating notebook and libraries

The validating notebook uses Pluto's package management system (introduced in version 0.15 of Pluto), and works from the current release version of all packages it depends on.



## Status

The validating notebook is still under development.  The [project issue tracker](https://github.com/HCMID/validatormodel/issues) includes a [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/HCMID/validatormodel/milestone/1) listing issues that define a 1.0 standard for cross-project validation of MID standards.
