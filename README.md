# HC MID template repository, version `0.17.0`

This is a template repository illustrating HC MID validation and verification using an interactive Pluto notebook.

Current documentation for setting up and working with an editing repository based on or copied from this model is available at <https://hcmid.github.io/tutorial2021/>.


## About the validating notebook and libraries

The validating notebook uses Pluto's package management system (introduced in version 0.15 of Pluto), and works from the current release version of all packages it depends on.



## Roadmap to 1.0

The validating notebook is still under development.  The [project issue tracker](https://github.com/HCMID/validatormodel/issues) includes a [1.0 milestone](https://github.com/HCMID/validatormodel/milestone/1) listing issues that define a 1.0 standard for cross-project validation of MID standards.


- [x] `v0.16.0`: rewrite using updated packages.  Verification of DSE indexing and of configurable orthography.
- [ ] `v1.0.0`:  comprehensive validation of configuration data, and of referential integrity in indexing and editing.
